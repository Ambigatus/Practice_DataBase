# Practice_DataBase
Small project to practice my skills with Python and SQL.
For practice, I created a small database and some programs to visualise data from it. 
The data is freely available - information about movies in 2023 from iMDB. The data was generated in the database using SQL, data manipulation and visualisation - Python, in particular Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy libraries.
